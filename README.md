This is my blog
===============

It is automatically transformed by [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) into a static site whenever I push this repository to GitHub.

The basic skeleton was cloned from [Tom Preston-Werner](http://tom.preston-werner.com/) of [GitHub](https://github.com/) fame.

The design was heavily inspired by [Medium](https://medium.com/).
